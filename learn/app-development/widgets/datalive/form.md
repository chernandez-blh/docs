Using a Form widget, you can build a form with a group of input fields for entering data. For example, a simple contact form, registration form, login form, and more. Based on your requirements, you can create forms with text fields, email, date, dropdown, checkboxes, and more. Plus, you can add validations to the fields to get quality and accurate information from the users. 

Additionally, build more complex form that contain multiple data widgets inside a single form, and form inside another form called repeated sections.

## Different Types of Forms

To work with data correctly, you should select a suitable type of form. There are two types of forms in WaveMaker; they are Forms and Live Forms. 

### Form

You can use Forms to build from scratch by using a [model variable](/learn/app-development/variables/model-variable), or you can use [web services]() or [java services]() through API calls.

### Live Form

For Live Form, you can work with more complex datasets, particularly when you import a database from an external resource to perform CRUD operations.


:::note
Form and Live Form are two different widgets that work similarly. However, Live Form is used for DB Services with CRUD operations only. For more information, see [Live Forms](/learn/app-development/widgets/datalive/live-form).

## How do Forms work

A form contains a group of input fields. Each field binds to the variable input parameter, and you can configure the field settings.

- Select a suitable form widget for the field. For example, text widget, radio button widget, or other.
- Field input validation. For example, should the field be a required field, or should it contain a regex?
- Reset form field data. For example, to clear entered data to start over. 
- Allow performing actions. For example, edit, save or submit data, and add a new record. 
- Select form layout styles. For example, display form fields in a single column, two columns, or three columns.
